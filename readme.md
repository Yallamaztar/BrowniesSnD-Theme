# Brownies Pack ‚Äì Cyan / Light Blue Theme for Plutonium T6MP

This is a **cyan / light blue** (idk) **visual theme** for **Plutonium T6 Multiplayer**. It changes menu images and UI elements to give a fresh, light-blue look with other little fun stuff added :)

**Installation:**  
No .iwd mod required ‚Äî just **drag and drop** or use the included installer:

1. **Automatic:**  
   - Run `install.bat` and it will copy all files to the correct Plutonium directories.  

2. **Manual:**  
   - Copy the contents of the `images` folder to:  
     ```
     %LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t6\images
     ```  
   - Copy the contents of the `raw` folder to (not suggested):  
     ```
     %LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t6\raw
     ```  
   - Keep the folder structure intact for proper functionality.
